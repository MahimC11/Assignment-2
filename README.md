This Website is a site that will be used to host a simple trivia quiz.

## UX
This website will be mainly used by people who would like to do a quiz.

## Features

### All pages
- Home Page and Quiz Page both have an interactive navbar.

### index.html (homepage)
- The homepage has a button after the "how to play instrcutions" that takes you to the quiz page. This button works the same as the quiz button on the navbar.

### quiz.html
- This page is where the actual quiz is hosted and uses a script made with Javascript.

### Upcoming Features
- A new feature that could be added may be a review section for the quiz that allows you to see which questions you have answered correctly and which answeres you answered incorrectly.

## Used Technologies
- [**HTML5**] This has been used to develop the basic elements on the website.
-[**CSS3**] CSS3 has been used in order to style the elements held on the website.
-[**Bootstrap**] Bootstrap has been used in order ot provide a responsive grid system as well as some pre-made styles.
-[**JavaScript**] JavaScript has been used in order to add some functionality onto the website.
-[**Git**] Git has been used in order to implement a version ccontrol system that can add and commit changes on the project before pushing them onto GitHub
-[**GitHub**] GitHub is used as  aremote repository that will hold and changes that are pushed from my local repository. I will aslo use GitHub Pages to deploy the website into a live environment.

## Testing

### All pages
- Media Links in the footer need links. (The Github Link leads to the github page for the site)

### index.html
- Navbar works correctly
- The Play now button works correctly

### quiz.html
- The navbar works properly
- The Quiz is fully functional with no issues.
- Once a button is pressed on the quiz, it will stay resized for the next question. (This can be fixed by resizing the button once pressed.)

### Other testing notes
- The button issue on the quiz which caused the buttons to be oversized on mobile has now been fixed.

## Deployment

I have decided to use Github Pages to host my website. To deploy my website to GitHub pages, I used the following steps:

1. Loaded the terminal window in Visual Studio Code.
2. Initialised Git using the `git init` command.
3. Added all files to the Staging area (Git) using the `git add .` command.
4. Committed the files to Git using the `git commit -m "Initial commit"` command.
5. Created a new repository in GitHub titles 'Assignment-2'.
6. Copied the below code from GitHub into the terminal window in Visual Studio Code:

    ```git remote add origin https://github.com/MahimC11/Assignment-2```

    ```git push -u origin master```

7. Entered my GitHub username and password to push the files from Git to GitHub.
8. Went into 'Settings' on my repository page in GitHub.
9. Selected the 'master branch' option under the 'GitHub Pages' section.
10. Ran several regular commits throughout my project.
